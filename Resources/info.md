## Here’s how you can structure it in a standardized, IEEE-inspired workflow with proper documentation, PCB rules, and traceable references.

1️⃣ Documentation Standards
We’ll follow IEEE 829 / IEEE 1016 / IEEE 1062 style for technical documentation.

Documents you’ll keep:

Doc Name	IEEE Standard	Purpose
Project Requirements Specification (PRS)	IEEE 830 / 29148	Define features, constraints, and objectives clearly.
System Design Description (SDD)	IEEE 1016	Describe architecture, block diagrams, data flow.
PCB Design Rule Document	IPC-2221 + Manufacturer specs	State all trace widths, clearances, stack-up, via rules.
Test Plan (TP)	IEEE 829	Define how each feature will be tested.
Bill of Materials (BOM)	Industry standard	Full part list with references, links, datasheets.
User Manual (UM)	IEEE 1063	For future users to understand how to operate your dev board.
Maintenance Plan	IEEE 14764	Describe possible revisions, firmware updates, and part replacements.

2️⃣ PCB Design Rules
Standard Reference: IPC-2221B (Generic Standard on Printed Board Design).

Common professional rules:

Trace width for power: 0.5–1 mm (adjust based on current)

Signal trace width: ≥ 6 mil

Clearance: ≥ 6 mil

Via drill size: ≥ 0.3 mm

Ground pour on all free copper areas

Keep analog and digital grounds separated until star point

USB D+/D- differential pair impedance: 90 Ω ± 10%

In EasyEDA, create a custom DRC (Design Rule Check) profile and save it as PCB_Rules.json in your repo.

3️⃣ Version Control & Traceability
Each doc, schematic, and PCB revision is stored in GitHub.

Commit messages reference Task IDs and Document Revisions (e.g., T07: Created schematic v1.0 per SDD-RevA).

Use GitHub Releases for tagging milestones:

v0.1-alpha → first schematic

v0.2-beta → PCB ordered

v1.0 → first working board

4️⃣ Learning References
PCB Design:

IPC-2221B free summary PDF

ESP32 Hardware Design Guidelines (Espressif)

Embedded Systems:

“Mastering FreeRTOS” by Real Time Engineers Ltd.

Espressif ESP-IDF documentation

Mechanical CAD:

Fusion 360 basic mechanical enclosure design tutorials.

5️⃣ Weekly Execution
Your .md task list already works for execution — just add a "Doc Ref" column so each task can link to its related IEEE doc section.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
T07 | Create schematic in EasyEDA | Ref: SDD Section 4.2
T08 | Add USB-UART bridge | Ref: SDD Section 4.3
6️⃣ Final Deliverables for Portfolio
GitHub repo with:

/docs → All IEEE-style PDFs and source .md docs

/pcb → EasyEDA source + Gerbers + DRC profile

/firmware → ESP-IDF + FreeRTOS code

/mechanical → Fusion 360 files + STL
