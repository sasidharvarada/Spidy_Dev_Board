## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The ESP32 Modular Portable Dev Board is designed for **IoT developers** and **students** to efficiently test IoT nodes, sensors, and various communication protocols.
The board will serve as a **customizable test jig** for the developer‚Äôs personal projects, allowing flexibility and easy integration of modules, sensors, and power sources.

### 1.2 Scope

The device will:

* Provide hardware-level protocol testing (I¬≤C, SPI, UART, Modbus, RS-485, etc.).
* Support multiple power input modes (USB, battery, external supply).
* Include integrated display, buttons, and indicators for stand-alone operation.
* Offer a compact, portable form factor with a small breadboard for prototyping.
* Use an **ESP32 module with built-in Wi-Fi and BLE** for wireless connectivity.
* Integrate **Battery Management System (BMS)** for safe charging, discharging, and monitoring of the Li-ion battery.
